# MensaWidget
## Welcome

This is a Mensa Widget that allows users seeing the lunch options from different outlets on the Uni Campus Griebnitzsee, inside the sqeak environment.

## Download
Make sure you have a squeak image installed.
Then drag and drop the project via the provided .sar file into your squeak image.
Should you encounter problems, you can try to install manually via Apps > File List and "install SAR".

## Activation
To enable the MensaWidget icon, go to Apps > Preference Browser > Docking bars and set Show 'Mensa' to enabled.
A burger icon should appear in your docking bar.
To register the MensaWidget in your Squeak Apps, open up a Workspace and do "MWFrame register" once.
In your Squeak Apps you should now be able to find the MensaWidget.

## Usage
To open, either click on the burger and choose option "Potsdam" or click on the MensaWidget App.
You can also start the MensaWidget from a Workspace by doing "MWFrame new".
After successfully opening the MensaWidget, select a day via the arrow keys or change the desired time to see meals from either lunch or dinner.
Choose your food option and if you enjoyed it, give it a star.
This will remind you that you liked this meal, should it ever be offered again.

Enjoy your meal!
